## InventNet
This is a very simple application I developed to get familiar with
Rails, TDD/BDD, Twitter Bootstrap, and a number of commonly used gems. Feel free to use and abuse it, but do not expect evolutions or support of any kind. You should not expect this to be "good" code either, it was really *just* a learning ground.

A working version is deployed on heroku and accessible here: http://www.inventnet.me

I have stripped sensitive information (secret tokens, etc.) from the
latest commits. The information you can find in older commits is no
longer valid.
