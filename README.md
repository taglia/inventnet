## InventNet
This is a very simple application I developed to get familiar with Rails, TDD, Twitter Bootstrap, and a number of commonly used gems. Feel free to use and abuse it, but do not expect evolutions or support of any kind. You should not expect this to be "good" code either, it was really *just* a learning ground.

A working version is deployed here: http://inventnet.me
